# postdoc-stuff
Ad Hoc code for postdoc work (main code is not public)

All the code herein has documentation of its use at the top of the file. The crimiercomp2.txt file goes with the plotcrim.py function, which was for generating a figure in my first postdoc paper, which you can read at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...657A..70P/abstract Pretty niche, but it might give you some ideas of how to handle data from lots of different sources on the same plot.
